Phase 3 is to Install or Run the Open Source Project, also reproduce the results.
My project is VQA, I choose to do the Tensorflow 2 Detection Model Zoo, as my teammates choose the Word-level language modeling RNN.
Here is the github link. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md
This model needs to be run under TensorFlow2.2 and Python 3.6.
Since, I already have python 3.8, so first, I install the TensorFlow with pip. Here is the instruction link.

I suppose to create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a .\venv directory to hold it, and activate the virtual environment.
But it is not working on Windows Powershell.
So I press WindowsKey + R, and type cmd when the box comes up, it brings up the command line interface instead of powershell. Then I can install TensorFlow in it.

From COCO website, We can easily find their Dataset.
